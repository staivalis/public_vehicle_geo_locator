# public_vehicle_geo_locator

Flutter project to gps-pin your vehicle using Firebase as backend

As you will observe, there is only the main.dart file included. This means, that if you want to try the project, you have to create a new flutter project locally and just add the code in your main.dart file.

The code is very simple, although it can for sure be optimised. However, it works.

Also, you might have observed, that you need Firebase as the backend for this project.
You have to create a new Firebase project and link it to this Flutter project (you can understand this also from the import statements on the top of the file).

Some of the texts on the buttons/alerts are in Greek. I left them intentionally, if you do not speak greek, you can use google translate !
